# 🚦 Traffic Object Detection using Deep Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for detecting vehicles and traffic-related objects in images or video frames using a deep learning model. The project utilizes modern object detection algorithms, such as YOLOv8, to identify multiple vehicle types in complex traffic scenarios.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Real-time object detection from traffic images or video streams
- ✅ Detects multiple types of vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, etc.)
- ✅ Performance analysis and visual output
- ✅ Model tuning and inference implementation

## 🧠 Model Details

- Framework: PyTorch / Ultralytics YOLO (based on your code)
- Model: YOLOv8 or custom-trained CNN model
- Input: Traffic scene images or video
- Output: Detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels
